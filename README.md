# stmidi
USB MIDI to serial converter

# how code was developed

1. Since CDC USB class is similar to MIDI device...
    CDC USB class code was generated by stm32cube (based on stmidi.ioc)
2. entire application code was put into stmidi/app
3. genarated files was copied to stmidi/app, renamed and then reworked
    /stmidi/USB_DEVICE/App/usbd_desc.h -> app/usb/usbd_midi_desc.h
    /stmidi/USB_DEVICE/App/usbd_desc.c -> app/usb/usbd_midi_desc.c
    /stmidi/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Device_Library/Class/CDC/Src/usbd_cdc.h -> app/usb/usbd_midi.h
    /stmidi/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Device_Library/Class/CDC/Src/usbd_cdc.c -> app/usb/usbd_midi.c
    /mnt/storage/projects/stm32cube_ws/midi2/USB_DEVICE/App/usbd_cdc_if.h -> app/usb/usbd_midi_if.h
    /mnt/storage/projects/stm32cube_ws/midi2/USB_DEVICE/App/usbd_cdc_if.c -> app/usb/usbd_midi_if.c
4. generated code was modified (only user sections) to use app/usb/usbd_midi.h/c and
    usbd_midi_desc.h/c, instead of original CDC defnitions
    (original CDC files was not removed, since after stm32cube code re-generation they would appear again,
     unused CDC symbols are removed by linker, so unused CDC files are left as they are,
     with such approach code could be re-generated by stm32cube many times without damaging user code)
